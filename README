MemoryFreak is an app designed to provide users with the ability to change their lmk settings to a variety of pre-defined values. MemoryFreak will also provide controls to adjust ZRAM size, and Swappiness values. Other memory-related controls may be added in the future. MemoryFreak is being designed and tested on a Samsung Captivate running eXistZ's Talon kernel. While any i-9000 based phone running Talon kernel MAY be able to run MemoryFreak, I CANNOT gaurantee compatibility. Nor may I, or anyone else involved in this project, or any projects that this project builds on, be held liable or accountable for any damages/losses incurred by using this app!!

A huge Thank You!! goes to eXistZ @ xda, kodos96 @ xda, ytt3r @ xda, and zacharias.maladroit @ xda. They developed and are maintaining the Talon kernel, and without the Talon kernel, this app would not be!!
